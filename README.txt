Files

qPCR_knockdown.xlsx
-- quantitative real time PCR quantification of Uhg4 knockdown in the Uhg4 deletion lines, with delta-delta ct values for the control and deletion lines

qPCR_knockdown_raw.xls
-- quantitative real time PCR data for Uhg4 and GAPDH

sanger_uhg4del.fas

sleep_activity_raw
-- directory containing raw DAM monitor .txt files and a metadata file

sleep_activity_foranalysis
-- directory containing sleep phenotype .csv files used for analysis, after elimination of dead flies, sorting out day vs night, activity vs sleep from ShinyRDAM outputs

stress_dev-viability.xlsx
